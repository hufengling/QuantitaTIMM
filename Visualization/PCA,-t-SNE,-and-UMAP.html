# PCA

# What is PCA?

* Stands for Principle Components Analysis

* Method based in linear algebra (works with matrices)

* A way of "squinting" at data such that the data "looks" a certain way

    * The first direction (axis) you "squint" along contains the most information

    * Given the first axis, the second axis you "squint" along contains the next-most information AND is perpendicular to the first axis

    * And so on, until you've "looked" along all axes

* Each of these new axes you have found are called "principle components" (PCs)

* Essentially, PCA is a rotation of some high-dimensional space, such that the rotation has certain special properties

# Primer in Linear Algebra

* The normal Cartesian plane has the x axis and y axis


```r
df &lt;- data.frame(x = 5, y = 4)
ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
  xlim(-10, 10) + ylim(-10, 10) + 
  theme_ipsum_rc()
```

* We can define any point by how much we have to "walk" in the x and y directions, from the point (0, 0) to get there

    * This point is named (5, 4) and can't be named anything else

    * (5, 4) refers to this point and isn't the name of anything else

* But there's no reason we have to "walk" along the x and y axes

    * For example, we can also define points by how much we walk along the lines `\(y = x\)` and `\(y = -x\)`

---
* So what does this look like?

![](PCA,-t-SNE,-and-UMAP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--
* Now, the same point is called (4.5, -0.5)

* We "walk" 4.5 units along `\(y = x\)` and -0.5 units along `\(y = -x\)`

* Nothing is actually changing, we are just changing our perspective

--
* BUT look at how close the point is to one of our new axes!

    * If we just called it (4.5), we would be mostly correct! (Off by 0.5)

    * Compare to the "default" perspective. If we called the point (5), we would be off by 4

---

* Of note, our "new" perspective still has perpendicular (also called "orthogonal") axes

    * There's no reason why this has to be the case

    * But they behave nicely and PCA always finds perpendicular axes
--
* Also note our "default" perspective had two axes and so does our new one

    * This has to be the case

    * Axes cannot be parallel (or else you couldn't move "up" or "down")
---

# Back to PCA

* Essentially, PCA asks, "Is there some special perspective we can take so some axes 'carry' more information?"

![](PCA,-t-SNE,-and-UMAP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--
![](PCA,-t-SNE,-and-UMAP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

* If we squint along this line, we can refer to every point by only one number and be **mostly** correct!

.footnote[
I visually guess-timated this line...
]

---

# Example
* Of course, we are still losing information, unless we use as many axes as we originally had

* BUT while each axis in "default" perspective carries, on average, 1/d (1/2 in two dimensions) of the information, we can rotate our axes to "concentrate" information along certain axes

* PCA is guaranteed to find the best axes to concentrate information (also called "explain variance").

##        eigenvalue percentage of variance cumulative percentage of variance
## comp 1  1.8676594              93.382969                          93.38297

```

* In our plot, the axis I drew (assuming I guess-timated correctly) accounts for 93.38% of the information ("variance") in the data

* If we needed to use fewer dimensions, we could just use that one and only lose 6.617% of the information in the data!

---

# High-Dimensional Example
* This process generalizes to higher dimensions easily (though it's impossible to think about intuitively)

* We can look at the MNIST dataset, which contains a lot of images of digits



![](PCA,-t-SNE,-and-UMAP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

* We can run PCA on this dataset (784 dimensions!)

# Take-aways
* The first two PCs don't do well at separating digits

    * Note the axes are less meaningful - one of the costs of PCA

![](PCA,-t-SNE,-and-UMAP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
--

* This is entirely expected as the first two PCs only explain 11.5691628 of the total variation (I used R code to display this number!)
    
    * Also, while PCA has applications in visualization, it is NOT specifically built for it
    
    * PCA has uses in dimension reduction, PC-regression, and more

# t-SNE
---
# What is t-SNE?

* Stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
    
    * Involves an element of randomness (stochastic). PCA always gives the same, best result. t-SNE can't guarantee "best" but looks for "as good as it can find"
    
    * Looks to preserve high-dimensional local neighborhoods, but doesn't care about global relationships
    
    * Involves a t-distribution (looks like a normal distribution, but fades out more slowly.)
    
* Specifically designed for visualization - it's used for nothing else

---
# Intuition

* In high-dimensional space, everything is REALLY far away from everything else

    * In 1-D, the (0) and (1) are only 1 unit away from each other
    
    * But in 2-D, maybe the points are actually (0, 0) and (1, 10000) - they're now more than 10,000 units apart
    
    * As you add dimensions, the problem becomes exponentially worse
    
* So t-SNE gives up, pretty much entirely, on preserving global (far away) relationships and focuses on local relationships

    * Gets highly penalized when it places nearby points far away from each other, but not much penalty if it places far points too far or not far enough
    
    * Also, has to use a special, probability-based measurement for "distance," since things are all far in "normal" distance (Euclidean)
    
---
# Example
* We can run t-SNE on our MNIST dataset to plot ("embed") the high-dimensional data in two dimensions (k = 2)

    * You can also embed into three dimensions, but 3-D visualizations (for t-SNE and anything else) are **almost** always a bad idea because our brains interpret them in 2-D

* Perplexity is the main tuning parameter in t-SNE and changes the balance of emphasis in global and local relationships

    * High perplexity emphasizes global relationships
    
    * Low perplexity emphasizes local relationships
    
* Need to try multiple perplexities to find one that works for your solution (5-50 is suggested)
---


```r
mnistTSNE &lt;- tsne(mnist[, 1:784], k = 2, max_iter = 500, perplexity = 20)

*mnistTSNE &lt;- mnistTSNE %&gt;% cbind(mnist$y) %&gt;% as.data.frame()
mnistTSNE$V3 &lt;- as.factor(mnistTSNE$V3)


ggplot(mnistTSNE) + geom_point(aes(V1, V2, color = V3)) + theme_ipsum_rc()
```

![](PCA,-t-SNE,-and-UMAP_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Take-aways
* This looks a lot better than PCA!

    * Could probably look even better if I tried more perplexities, or allowed more iterations to try and "improve" the embedding
    
    
* Because global structure is so deemphasized, cluster size does not mean anything

    * Neither do distances between clusters
    
    * Axes are entirely arbitrary. PCA axes have some meaning based on what variables make up the axes you are "squinting" down, but t-SNE axes truly mean nothing.

# UMAP

---
# What is UMAP?

* Stands for Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection

* Intuition of UMAP is very similar to t-SNE

    * Prioritizes local structure
    
    * Uses some different measurement for distance
    
    * Is stochastic (can't solve for "best" but improves as much as it can)
    
* Also has tuning parameters (n_neighbors and min_dist) to balance emphasis on local vs global structure

    * High values for both emphasize global structure
    
    * Low valuesfor both emphasize local structure
    
* BUT claims to be faster than t-SNE AND preserve more global structure

---

```r
mnistUMAP &lt;- umap(mnist[, 1:784])


mnistUMAP &lt;- mnistUMAP[[1]] %&gt;% cbind(mnist$y) %&gt;% as.data.frame()
mnistUMAP$V3 &lt;- as.factor(mnistUMAP$V3)


ggplot(mnistUMAP) + geom_point(aes(V1, V2, color = V3)) + theme_ipsum_rc()
```

]

---

# Take-aways
* Like in t-SNE, tuning parameters matter

* Cluster sizes are meaningless

* Cluster distances, while more meaningful than t-SNE, are still very meaningless

* Axes are also meaningless

---

# t-SNE vs UMAP

* As far as I understand, t-SNE is still used often

    * Partly because it was the first major breakthrough in high-dimensional visualization
    
    * Party because people are more familiar with it, since it's been around longer
    
* But UMAP completely dominates t-SNE in every way

    * Fills the exact same niche as t-SNE 
    
    * (Comparing to PCA, PCA is much worse at visualization, but has arguable advantages in terms of interpretability. PCA also has other applications.)
    
    * Preserves more global structure and faster!
